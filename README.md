## Implementation Details

- The card templates are created using HTML and CSS.
- CSS is utilized for styling, making the cards visually appealing, and ensuring consistency across the application.
- The `application.js` file contains the main logic for updating card statuses. This includes event handling, manipulation of the DOM based on user actions, and updating the visual representation of each card to reflect its current state.
-  The HomeController class was used to create a mock response by storing all the card info in an array.
